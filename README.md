I used home.html instead of index.html for the landing page.

Light javascript for smooth scrolling, automatically setting the dates on the Class Schedule page, and the modal window that asks if you are sure when you "log out".

I wanted to do more but felt I had already spent too much time here. For example, I wish I had consolidated the files into folders based on type, the way I did with the images.

I resized the images. Their intrinsic size is now double their displayed size. Everything on unsplash is enormous.

Hope this is what you were looking for.
